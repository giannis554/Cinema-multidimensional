Cinema-multidimensional Arrays
The cinema has n rows, each row consists of m seats (n and m do not exceed 20). A two-dimensional matrix stores the information on the sold tickets:
the number 1 means that the ticket for this place is already sold, and the number 0
means that the place is available. You want to buy k tickets to neighboring seats in the same row. Find whether it can be done.
